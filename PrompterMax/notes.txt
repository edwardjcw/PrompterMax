I stopped with a lot of what needs to be done, done. For some reason the manual recording goes through the motions but doesn't actually
record (or at least it doesn't appear to record anything). So that needs to be looked at.

Additionally, the next/previous/goto buttons needs to stop the recording. I don't think we should have auto next record since we have
the auto advance technology.

The main branch works. My issue now is getting the sample rate higher on the auto next feature. I'm trying to use memory streams but
it doesn't seem to fill up with anything.

Focus on the RawSourceWaveStream.

Perhaps focus on the reason it's not writing to file. It seems there's data in there, so why isn't it writing?

Fixed the saving part by pushing the position of the stream back to 0 before saving, but still not saving as a wav. Tried WasapiLoopback
but doesn't appear to work. Getting 0 bytes.

FINALLY got the thing to record the 000 file and even record voice by setting a 5 second interval between giving recognizer more audio stream.
It works but breaks down once recognition happens. This is likely because recognition is done async. We get recorder stopped when we shouldn't. LINE 87 mainwindow, we do stop the recognizer. This causes a cascade of things, including making null the wave file writer.
Why doesn't the start line below that restart everything?
