I stopped with a lot of what needs to be done, done. For some reason the manual recording goes through the motions but doesn't actually
record (or at least it doesn't appear to record anything). So that needs to be looked at.

Additionally, the next/previous/goto buttons needs to stop the recording. I don't think we should have auto next record since we have
the auto advance technology.

The main branch works. My issue now is getting the sample rate higher on the auto next feature. I'm trying to use memory streams but
it doesn't seem to fill up with anything.
