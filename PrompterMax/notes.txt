There is no value returned by the NextPrompt ... so can it really be a ObjectDataProvider?

Created a Metric class to control the recognition accuracy and speech to noise ratio metrics. Next is to connect it to the xaml and modify the xaml.cs to use Metric.

Got the recognition accuracy binding to work. Would like to apply that to most now. 
For the speech to noise ratio, I really need to create an Accuracy class that has recognition accuracy and speech to noise ratio.

Beginning to introduce Accuracy to the program. I'm using the Levenshtein distance to determine how closely the audio (as recognized) is to the phrase.

I'm only at the beginning. I got it to work for a couple, but using the F# recursive seems to slow things down. I may just want to use the C# version.

I stopped with a lot of what needs to be done, done. For some reason the manual recording goes through the motions but doesn't actually
record (or at least it doesn't appear to record anything). So that needs to be looked at.

Additionally, the next/previous/goto buttons needs to stop the recording. I don't think we should have auto next record since we have
the auto advance technology.
